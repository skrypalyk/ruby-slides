  <h2>Message expectations</h2>
  <h3>Setting responses</h3>

  <p>Whether you are setting a message expectation or a method stub, you can tell the object precisely how to respond. The most generic way is to pass a block to stub or should_receive:</p>

  <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: ruby">
    expect(double).to receive(:msg) { value }
  </script>

  <p>When the double receives the msg message, it evaluates the block and returns the result.</p>

  <p>The same responses are available, as for stub method:</p>
  <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: ruby">
    expect(double).to receive(:msg).and_return(value)
    # returns value1 the first time, value2 the second, etc
    expect(double).to receive(:msg).exactly(3).times.and_return(value1, value2, value3)
    # error can be an instantiated object or a class
    expect(double).to receive(:msg).and_raise(error)
    expect(double).to receive(:msg).and_throw(:msg)
    expect(double).to receive(:msg).and_yield(values,to,yield)
    # for methods that yield to a block multiple times
    expect(double).to receive(:msg).and_yield(values,to,yield).and_yield(some,other,values,this,time)
  </script>

  <p>When working with a partial mock object, you may occasionally want to set a message expecation without interfering with how the object responds to the message. </p>
  <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: ruby">
    expect(Person).to receive(:find).and_call_original
    Person.find # => executes the original find method and returns the result
  </script>
